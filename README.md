<H1>Cookbook</H1>

<H2>Basic functions</H2>
<P>Lets user add recipe. Title, ingredients, instructions and set speed/difficulty.</P>
<P>Shows a full list of saved recipes, and can click to go to that recipe</P>
<P>Randomizes recipes.</P>
<p>Saves files locally in a JSON, in "MyDocuments/Kokboken/Recept.Json"</p>

<H2>Why did you make this?</H2>
<p>Me and my girlfriend always struggling with coming up with something to eat, so the randomizer function takes care of that.</p>
<p>Wanted to see if i could make something from scratch into a working application, using C# and MAUI</p>
<p>To have all our recipes stored in one single place.</p>
